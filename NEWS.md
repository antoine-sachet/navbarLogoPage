# navbarLogoPage 1.0

* Rename package `navbarLogoPage` as this is really the only thing the package does.

* Restart git repository from scratch. This was initially a fork of `shiny` and it was very messy.
  This will allow a proper tagging and release scheme.
  
* This project hasn't received updates in years but still runs in a few apps in prod.

# shinyhelpr 0.0.2

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

* Logo css can be controlled with the `logo_css` argument.

# shinyhelpr 0.0.1

* Initial version
